to import image we shouldn't use src='path to image' this is will not work because of the build workflow here is set.At the end webpack will take all these files bundle them together and create a new output folder.we can see that because we are in development mode where all of that will happen in memory but once when we deploy our app we will get a new output file where all the optimized, compiled and bundled code will be contained in.Therefore the assets folder(where we store images) as well as the src folder will not be shipped.hence to make webpack aware that we are using an image we should import that image into our js file and behind the scenes webpack will handle this using a plugin or module and will copy it over the destination directory it creates, but in memory during development mode.
the import identifier will receive the path of the image webpack will copy it to in production mode.
